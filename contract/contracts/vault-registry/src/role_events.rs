//! Complete actor / previous / replacement payloads for admin-role events (#29).
//!
//! Before this module the admin and recovery-admin events carried only the new
//! account (or, for `recover`, an untyped `(old, new)` tuple), so an indexer
//! could not tell who authorized a change or which account it replaced. Every
//! admin-role mutation now publishes a [`RoleRotation`].

use soroban_sdk::{contracttype, Address, Env, Symbol};

/// Payload of the `setadmin`, `nomadmin`, `accadmin`, `setrecov` and `recover`
/// events.
///
/// - `actor`: the account whose authorization performed the change.
/// - `previous`: the account holding the role slot before the change, if any
///   (the current admin for `nomadmin`, the old admin for `accadmin` and
///   `recover`, the old recovery admin for `setrecov`).
/// - `replacement`: the account that holds, or was nominated for, the slot
///   afterwards; `None` when the slot was cleared (`set_recovery_admin(None)`).
